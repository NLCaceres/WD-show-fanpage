# A Walking Dead Fan Page

Simple fan page for the Walking Dead based on a few episodes and a few descriptions of the seasons

## Description

My first assignment from USC's Intro to Web Dev class. As a basic assessment of our knowledge of HTML and CSS,
we were instructed to come up with a fanpage for one of our favorite shows. At the time, Walking Dead was
at its height and fans were reeling from Season 7's premiere.
